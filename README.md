Crime Hotspot Detection 🚨
Enhancing Public Safety with Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview
Crime Hotspot Detection is a machine learning-based approach to identify high-crime areas in Los Angeles from 2020 to 2024. The project utilizes LAPD crime data to provide actionable insights, enabling law enforcement and city planners to implement targeted security measures for a safer community.

🎯 Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately identifies crime hotspots by analyzing crime trends and patterns. The model offers:
✅ Data-driven insights for crime prevention strategies.
✅ Improved resource allocation for law enforcement.
✅ Enhanced public awareness for safer urban planning.

🛠 Tech Stack & Tools
📌 Development Environment
Jupyter Notebook – Development & execution of Python scripts.
📌 Python Libraries
NumPy – Efficient numerical computations.
Pandas – Data cleaning, manipulation, and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn – Machine learning model implementation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization and exploratory analysis.
📊 Key Metrics & Performance
The model's performance was evaluated using standard classification metrics:

Training Accuracy: Measures the model’s performance on training data.
Test Accuracy: Evaluates how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
Cross-Validation Score: Ensures robustness by averaging performance across multiple data splits.
🚀 Machine Learning Models Implemented
Two predictive models were developed and tested:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
🔎 Model Selection & Optimization
Hyperparameter tuning was performed using Grid Search CV for optimal model performance.
After rigorous evaluation, Logistic Regression emerged as the best-performing model, providing a balance between accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, making it suitable for handling class imbalance.
🔮 Future Enhancements
While the results are promising, further improvements can be made by:
✔ Integrating additional datasets such as demographic and socioeconomic factors.
✔ Exploring deep learning models for improved crime prediction.
✔ Deploying the model via a web dashboard or API for real-time analysis.

📌 Conclusion
This project highlights how machine learning can be leveraged for crime prevention and urban safety. By refining predictive models and integrating external data sources, we can make data-driven decisions to improve public safety.
